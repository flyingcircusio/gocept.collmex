Introduction
============

Collmex is an online ERP system for (small) companies with a focus on simple
accounting. <http://www.collmex.de> (Note: Collmex is Germany-based but seems
to support English. You're bound to stumble over German strings, though.)

This package aims to provide pythonic bindings to program against Collmex'
API. It includes transaction management for integration with the ZODB or other
databases that can integrate with the `transaction` package.
