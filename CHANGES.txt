Changes
=======

1.8.1 (2016-06-09)
------------------

- Extend `Project` to retrieve budget and summed up work via API.


1.8.0 (2016-01-27)
------------------

- Declared compatibility with Python 3.4.

- Stopped promising compatibility with Python 3.2 since a) tests don't succeed
  with Python 3.2 and current test software b) nobody uses it anymore anyway.

- Made sure tests don't use invalid credentials on test account too many times
  in a row.

- Raise ``ValueError`` if the Collmex website returned an error during
  ``Collmex.browser_login``. Until now the error was hidden, but the following
  action failed. In particular this should help to spot invalid credentials.



1.7.0 (2014-09-04)
------------------

- Use collmex.ini file given by the path in environment variable
  ``COLLMEX_INI`` if present, only otherwise look upward from the current
  directory.

- Don't log the password in our debug output.


1.6.0 (2014-08-18)
------------------

- Un-deprecate method ``Collmex.create_invoice``, it now takes care of
  automatically allocating invoice ids.

- Add ``gocept.collmex.testing.ConsoleDump`` utility that fakes a collmex
  connection, but only logs method calls.
